## Remaining Tasks

> Some QoL improvements and things I missed

- [ ] Improve Styling on list page
  > Mainly just for QoL, it's currently usable but isn't that appealing to view.
- [ ] Adding Spinner or something to hide loading triggers
    > Another just QoL improvement
- [ ] Improving functionality of the details view.
    > mainly to improve API data handling and reduce redundant api calls.
- [ ] Display actually information on Details modal view.
    > oops...
  - [ ] Basic Pokemon Information; Stats, name, height weight
  - [ ] Species Info; Egg Groups, growth rate, etc.
  - [ ] Evolution Info; next evolutions, evolution triggers and items.
    > For looking at the JSON object from PokeAPI, this may be difficult with my current skill-set.

## Notes:

As of 17/02/21; currently not actively working on this project. I sorta hit a wall with the API data handling and am currently working on the ReactJS version of this project called react-dex, it's basically the same thing but using ReactJS. I am mainly using to compare my feeling and conformability on each of the framework? libraries?, not based on Job Market but that'll factor later when I have a better understanding on how they respectively work.

Vue 3 has been quite easy to work with and I especially like the composition API, and any difficulties due to my own lack of knowledge. Who knows maybe trying to do this on ReactJS will give some ideas on how to optimize and improve the Vue one.
