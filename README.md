# Vue-dex

__A Pokedex using PokeAPI, built with VueJS and Tailwind CSS.__

A simple project to Fetch Pokemon from the PokeAPI, display them as cards and allow the user to view basic information on the pokemon. 

> Status: Unfinished but I may return to it in the future as I work on the react version and regain motivation.

## Goals

This project is a means for me to Learn VueJS while also comparing it to ReactJS by creating the same project in both frameworks.

## Technologies

__Built with__
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Installation and Usage

__Yarn__ is my package manager of choice, but __npm__ should work as well as they both require __Node.js__ to work.

__Usage__
``` 
- Download and Extract Repo
- cd [project folder]
- run command yarn 
    > or npm equivalent to download packages
- run command yarn start 
```

__Alternatively__ visit the deployed site on [Vercel](https://vue-dex-e01pdiroz.vercel.app/).
